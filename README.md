# My portfolio site

## Overview
I created this project as part of having a portfolio website that I can use as a CV and where I can also showcase my completed projects.
The idea behind this is to use raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to keep it as simple as possible.
I chose not to have a backend server, as I want to focus only on these three topics.

## W – Walkthrough

Build a portfolio website, where I can showcase my projects, experience, skills, certifications and course completion, it should get the basic information from my LinkedIn profile.

## O – Open Up the Requirements

**Q**: Is the portfolio website server-side?
**A**: No, it is fully client-side.

**Q**: How will we call APIs without a backend?
**A**: Using GitHub Actions (or similar) to fetch data and generate a JSON file for the frontend.

## U - User Interface 
As I am not a designer, I chose to bully WebStudio's inception AI into building a layout I liked.

## L – Logic Design

These are the core topics I will be using:

* Async / Await (Promises)
* RapidAPI
* GitHub Actions
* HTML
* CSS

## D – Data Design

The data design is relative simple, as I get it delivered from an API.

* No database
* Pre-generated JSON file containing LinkedIn data
